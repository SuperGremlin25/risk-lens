## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initial Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Authenticate with Cloudflare
npx wrangler login

# Create KV namespaces
npm run setup:kv

# Update wrangler.toml with actual namespace IDs
# (Replace placeholder IDs with generated ones)
```

### 2. GitHub Secrets Configuration
Set these secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`: (Optional) Hugging Face API token

### 3. Deploy to Staging
```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```

### 4. Test Staging Deployment
```bash
# Replace with your actual staging URL
npm run validate:deployment https://risk-lens-staging.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

### 5. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Run pre-deployment checks
npm run pre-deploy

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

### 6. Validate Production Deployment
```bash
# Test all endpoints
npm run validate:deployment https://risk-lens-production.your-subdomain.workers.dev

# Monitor initial performance
npx wrangler tail risk-lens-production
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Health Checks
- [ ] `/api/health` endpoint responding correctly
- [ ] Main UI loads properly
- [ ] Contract analysis functionality working
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Error handling working properly

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Response times acceptable (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Cache hit rates reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation
- [ ] Global edge performance verified

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] Rate limiting preventing abuse
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] CORS working correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate rollback:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler rollback risk-lens-production [previous-version-id]
   ```

2. **Check deployment history:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deployments list risk-lens-production
   ```

3. **Verify rollback success:**
   ```bash
   npm run validate:deployment https://risk-lens-production.your-subdomain.workers.dev
   ```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Request volume and response times
- Error rates and types
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Rate limiting triggers
- Memory and CPU usage

### Log Monitoring
- Application errors
- Security events (rate limiting, invalid requests)
- Performance anomalies
- Deployment events

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- [ ] Review application logs
- [ ] Check error rates and performance
- [ ] Verify backup/rollback capability

### Monthly
- [ ] Security audit (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Dependency updates
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Quarterly
- [ ] Comprehensive security review
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Architecture review
